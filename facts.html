<h2>The more one studies mathematics, the more mysterious it becomes, with powers that seem quite 'spooky' and almost magical at times.so here let us see some cool Mathematics Facts</h2>
<ol>
<li>‘FOUR’ is the only number in the English language that is spelled with the same number of letters as the number itself.</li>
<li>If you multiply 6 by an even number, the answer will end with the same digit. The number in the ten’s place will be half of the number in the one’s place.</li>
<li>The only number, when written in English, that is spelt with its letters in alphabetical order is “forty”. The only number, when written in English, that is spelt with its letters in reverse alphabetical order is “one”.</li>
<li>Multiplying ones will always give you palindromic numbers.</li>

<li>A circle also has the shorted perimeter of any shape with the same area.</li>
<li> The word “hundred” comes from the old Norse term, “hundrath”, which actually means 120 and not 100.</li>
<li>Conversely, “one” is the only number that is spelt with letters arranged in descending order.</li>
<li> From 0 to 1000, the only number that has the letter “a” in it is “one thousand”.</li>
<li>“Eleven plus two” is an anagram of “twelve plus one” which is pretty fitting as the answer to both equations is 13.</li>
<li>Also, there are 13 letters in both “eleven plus two” and “twelve plus one”.</li>
<li>If you shuffle a deck of cards properly, it’s more than likely that the exact order of the cards you get has never been seen before in the whole history of the universe.
