<h2><b>Who is Euclid?</b></h2>
<P>Euclid , sometimes called Euclid of Alexandria[1] to distinguish him from Euclid of Megara, was a Greek mathematician, often referred to as the "founder of geometry"[1] or the "father of geometry". He was active in Alexandria during the reign of Ptolemy I (323–283 BC). His Elements is one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics, serving as the main textbook for teaching mathematics (especially geometry) from the time of its publication until the late 19th or early 20th century.[2][3][4] In the Elements, Euclid deduced the theorems of what is now called Euclidean geometry from a small set of axioms. Euclid also wrote works on perspective, conic sections, spherical geometry, number theory, and mathematical rigour.</P>

<P>Euclid was an ancient Greek mathematician in Alexandria, Egypt. Due to his groundbreaking work in math, he is often referred to as the 'Father of Geometry'. Euclid's most well-known collection of works, called Elements, outlines some of the most fundamental principles of geometry </P>
<h2><b>Euclid Prove</b></h2>
<P>Euclid proved that <B>“if two triangles have the two sides and included angle of one respectively equal to two sides and included angle of the other, then the triangles are congruent in all respect”.</b>In Figure 2, if AC = DF, AB = DE, and ∠CAB = ∠FDE, then the two triangles are congruent. This means that not only are the remaining sides and angles congruent, but the two triangles also have the same area.

In Proposition I.8, Euclid proved another congruence theorem. If two triangles have all three sides of one triangle equal to all three sides of the other triangle, the triangles are congruent. This is called the side-side-side theorem, or SSS.

Euclid showed how to construct a line perpendicular to another line in Proposition I.11. He showed that this line could be drawn from a point on the line or a point not on the line. This proposition was one of many construction proofs. Proposition I.14 considered when a line is straight. In I.13, Euclid showed that if line CBD in Figure 3 is a straight line, then the angles ∠CBA and ∠ABD sum to two right angles.</P>
