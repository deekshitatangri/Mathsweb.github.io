<h2><b>Who is Satendra Nath Bose?</b></h2>
<P>Satyendra Nath Bose, (born January 1, 1894, Calcutta [now Kolkata], India—died February 4, 1974, Calcutta), Indian mathematician and physicist noted for his collaboration with Albert Einstein in developing a theory regarding the gaslike qualities of electromagnetic radiation (see Bose-Einstein statistics).</P>
<h2><b> Satyendra Nath Bose Contribution to Mathematics</b></h2>
<P>In 1924, Bose made the biggest and the greatest breakthrough of his career when he finally wrote a paper in which he had derived the Planck's “quantum radiation law”. This he did by just counting the number of the identical states, without any kind of reference to any classical physics theories.Planck’s quantum law actually contained a factor from classical physics: 8πν2/c3. The mixing of classical and quantum theories in one equation had been a perpetual source of discomfort for physicists working in the field. Bose had been able to produce the 8πν2/c3 factor without using classical physics. Instead the factor arose naturally from the argument that photons with equal energy were indistinguishable from one another.</P>
<h2><b>The Bose–Einstein Condensate – A New Phase of Matter</b></h2>
<P>The more Einstein thought about Bose’s paper, the more he was impressed by the possibilities it offered. He decided to apply Bose’s quantum statistics to a gas made of atoms to see what effects might be expected.

At time B, the very dark peak indicates a region of high density; here about 2,000 atoms have merged to form a very dense ‘super-atom.’ Image from NIST.

This led to his prediction of the Bose–Einstein Condensate (BEC).
In a BEC each particle in a collection of particles exists in the same, identical quantum state – the particles are indistinguishable from one another.

In took over 70 years from Einstein’s prediction of BECs for a pure single entity to be seen.

This happened in 1995 when a gas of rubidium atoms was cooled to within a fraction of absolute zero: 1.7 × 10-7 kelvins, merging about 2,000 individual atoms into the same entity, a single super-atom, which held together for less than 20 seconds.</P>
