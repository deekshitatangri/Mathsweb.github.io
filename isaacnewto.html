<h1>Isaac Newton</h1>

<h2><B>who is Isaac Newton?</B></H2>
<P>Sir Isacc Newton was born on January 4, 1643, but in England they used the Julian Calender at that time and his birthday was on Christmas Day 1642. He was born in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire. His father had already passed prior to his birth and his mother remarried after his birth and left Isaac to live with her mother.</P>
<h2><B>What is Isaac Newton most famous for?</B></H2>
<P>Although Isaac Newton is well known for his discoveries in optics (white light composition) and mathematics (calculus), it is his formulation of the three laws of motion—the basic principles of modern physics—for which he is most famous. His formulation of the laws of motion resulted in the law of universal gravitation.</P>
<h2><B>Why was the discovery of gravity important?</B></H2>
<P>
Newton's theory helped prove that all objects, as small as an apple and as large as a planet, are subject to gravity. Gravity helped keep the planets rotating around the sun and creates the ebbs and flows of rivers and tides</P>
<h2><b>Isaac Newton Discovery</B></H2>
<P>First of all, you'll need to know who Isaac Newton was and why he was and remains so important. He was a physicist, mathematician and cosmologist who was prominent in the 17th century. He's probably best-known for formulating the laws of motion and universal gravitation. His influence can't be overstated. One of his many achievements was the invention of calculus. His own work in physics undoubtedly brought him to this issue, and he felt a need to solve it with a new mathematical framework that simply hadn't existed up to that point in time. His focus on gravity and laws of motion are linked to his breakthrough in calculus.

Newton started by trying to describe the speed of a falling object. When he did this, he found that the speed of a falling object increases every second, but that there was no existing mathematical explanation for this. The issue of movement and the rate of change had not yet been explored to any significant degree in the field of mathematics, so Newton saw a void that needed to be filled. He began work on this right way, incorporating planetary ellipses into his theory too to try to explain the orbit of the planets. He found that by using calculus, he could explain how planets moved and why the orbits of planets are in an ellipse.  This is one of Newton's break throughs: that the gravitational force that holds us to the ground is the same force that causes the planets to orbit the Sun and the Moon to orbit Earth.
All this shows that when Newton came to develop the idea of calculus and its focus on the rate of change, it fed into his previous work. He was aided by his already strong conceptual understanding of physics and movement. It wasn't a complete departure from his other work. And this perhaps demonstrates best of all the direct link between the field of mathematics and the field of physics. For Newton at least, the two went hand in hand. Newton used rates of changes to form the foundation of Calculus, and his revised theory was published in 1676. 

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz is another mathematician who did a lot of work on using numbers to help describe nature and motion. There was a dispute between the two men over who actually came up with calculus first and who the true inventor was. Although Leibniz did come up with vital symbols that help with the understanding of mathematical concepts, Newton's work was carried out about eight years before Leibniz's. Both men contributed a great deal to mathematics in general and calculus in particular. And since then, the concept has been developed even further.
