<h2><b>who is Carl Friedrich Gauss?</b></h2>
<p>Carl Friedrich Gauss, original name Johann Friedrich Carl Gauss, (born April30, 1777, Brunswick [Germany]—died February 23, 1855, Göttingen, Hanover), German mathematician
Gauss was the only child of poor parents. He was rare among mathematicians in that he was a calculating prodigy, and he retained the ability to do elaborate calculations in his head most of his life. Impressed by this ability and by his gift for languages, his teachers and his devoted mother recommended him to the duke of Brunswick in 1791, who granted him financial assistance to continue his education locally and then to study mathematics at the University of Göttingen from 1795 to 1798.</p>
<h2><b>Why is Carl Friedrich Gauss famous?</b></h2>
<p>Gauss is generally regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time for his contributions to number theory, geometry, probability theory, geodesy, planetary astronomy, the theory of functions, and potential theory (including electromagnetism).</p>
<h2><b>What awards did Carl Friedrich Gauss win?</b></h2>
<p>Gauss won the Copley Medal, the most prestigious scientific award in the United Kingdom, given annually by the Royal Society of London, in 1838 “for his inventions and mathematical researches in magnetism.” For his study of angle-preserving maps, he was awarded the prize of the Danish Academy of Sciences in 1823.</p>
